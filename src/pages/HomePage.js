    <h1>Hello! Welcome to my first blog/website!</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to my website! This is my first attempt at a personal website using React and Javascript.
    </p>
    <p>
        During the summer of 2019, I decided to create a website from scratch using nothing but online tutorials and videos.
        This was a tough, but worthwhile experience since I have never tried something like this before.
        For more of my thoughts, please check out my the article titled 'My Summer with React.'
    </p>
    <p>
        I know this website is pretty bare and minimum right now. For future iterations, I would finish a comment/upvoting feature, making it work 
        with MongoDB to update the total number of upvotes and comments. I would also take a look at stylizing more of the webpages to make it not look so bland. Anyways, please take a look around the website!
    </p>
    </React.Fragment>
