            `For the summer of 2019, I decided to dive into the world of full-stack development. At first, it seemed like a daunting task to create
            both the server and webpages for the website; and it really was. I found it especially difficult to get up and running with Javascript, since
            I have never worked with it before. However, after watching hours of videos on how to develop using Javascript, I started to work on my first website.
            It took me a while to get used to ES6 and programming in such an enviornment. I wish I could say I was an expert after building this website, but I still have a long way to go
            before calling myself even proficient. I will continue to develop using Javascript and hopefully create something more sophisticated!`,

            `Oh how time flies when you're having fun. I made so many memories with friends during my undergradute years at UVA. Through the grueling nights working on projects and homework,
            to falling off a 10 foot waterfall with friends, there's nothing better than sharing your favorite moments with the people you love. I look forward for what this semester has to offer and 
            making more memories and meeting more people. Go Hoos!`,
